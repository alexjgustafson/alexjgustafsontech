In the end, making new stuff requires knowing a little bit of everything. Many developers strive for depth in a speciality to make the most money at Google. I seek a pragmatic breadth of understanding so that you and I can make the next Google.

When my favorite tools don't fit the project, I'm not scared to abandon them in favor of something more appropriate. The best problems have nothing to do with what I know, and everything about what I can figure out.

Whatever you need created, I want to make it the best way possible.
