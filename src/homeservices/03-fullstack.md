Most web projects have way more going on behind the scenes than what shows up in the browser.

While I primarily focus on the front end, with the right stack I'm a fully competent full-stack developer. Whether we're taking a new project from start to MVP or multiple teams can use a hand, I enjoy being available as a jack of all trades. Architecting PHP applications, designing APIs, deploying infrastructure, version control and project management, and database queries are all game.
