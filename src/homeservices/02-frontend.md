Since 2017, I've handled front-end development for local agencies, startups, small businesses, and enterprise web applications. In all these contexts, consideration for how to make a web app, website, or PWA work as best as possible on any device takes professional effort. Oh and by the way, it needs to be stunningly beautiful.

Vue, React, Angular, Svelte, Preact... the front-end space advances everyday. But the princples of making a project work as best as possible for any human with any device remain the same.
