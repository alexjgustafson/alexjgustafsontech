After Automattic, I became a front-end developer at a local web agency. Pretty quickly I learned that every project needs a great deal of polish.

Sass, Gulp, Webpack, React, Gatsby... the front-end space advances everyday. But it's what I breath and I keep getting better. All in the name of making your stuff the coolest stuff whenever possible.
